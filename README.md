# water

> A program for watering indoor plants.

## Applications

Water small indoor plants using some Linux board with GPIO pins.
I use a Beaglebone black, but a Raspberry should be usable as well
with the same software and a different GPIO configuration.

The GPIO pins turn on small water pumpsfor a few seconds every day
to pump some water into the pots.
The pumps are driven from a 12V source via a ULN2003A driver.
